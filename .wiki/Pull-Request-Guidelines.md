In order to keep both the project and pull requests clean there are some guidelines you need to be aware of.

### General guidelines
* Create a <ins>**seperate branch**</ins> for <ins>**every Pull Request**</ins>. This way you can keep your branch(es) up-to-date with the upstream branch(es).
* A new Pull Request **must always** target the [**main**](https://github.com/Mr-Pineapple/AdditionalGuns/tree/main) branch **first**!
After your PR has been merged you may backport it to an older version if you wish and/or the version is still supported by the Additional Guns developers.
* Please make use of a *version control system* if you are contributing large quantities of code. (e.g. [Git](https://git-scm.com))

### Additional guidelines for model contributers
* Avoid using illegal character in file names. (e.g. spaces, ``*`` etc.) ``_`` and ``-`` are fine however.
* Try to optimize your model. Don't make it too big.
* Contributing just models and textures is enough.
The developers will take care of everything else.
  * However: keep in mind to provide as much information to your PR description as possible. (Like the gun properties/stats, crafting ingredients etc.)
